CS-E4580 Programming Parallel Computers
==============================================================

This repository contains my solutions to exercises of the course Programming Parallel Computers, which provided an in-depth learning experience to concepts of CPU and GPUs as well as enabled me to learn different ways to make use of parallellism in both CPU and GPU.

Some of the code segments were provided as templates by the course. For anyone interested learning more about programming parallel computers, I highly recommend one to take a look at https://ppc.cs.aalto.fi/.
